让合成表(Recipe Browser)Mod支持拼音及拼音首字母搜索
比如你想找“石头”，你可以输入“shitou”或者“st”来搜索，当然，输入“shit”也是可以的(什)
不用切换输入法，不用输入中文，甚至不用记住中文名(?)，只要知道拼音就可以搜索到了，是不是很方便捏

This mod is NOT for Recipe Browser users who don't know pinyin
However, if you want to know what is pinyin, here is a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin
Basically this mod added pinyin search support for Recipe Browser, so you can search for items in Chinese with pinyin.
